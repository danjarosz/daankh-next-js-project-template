# Base

The base for the entire template is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) created
using [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), based
on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

This combination of technologies produces the solid foundation for creating reliable and stable web applications.

Some parts of the configuration are specific for JetBrains WebStorm IDE, so if you use a different IDE, some files can
be unnecessary for you and there might be required to do some changes in the configuration.

# Linting

This project template uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org) configuration provided by Create Next App, so you probably
shouldn't modify it.

The only one modification that I have made is that ESLint respects code formatting provided by Prettier. This
modification was included in the file od `esling.config.mjs`

## Modifications

If it is required to modify ESLint configuration, you should modify these files:

- `esling.config.mjs`

## Scripts

Use

```bash
npm run lint
```

to lint through all the files in the project
